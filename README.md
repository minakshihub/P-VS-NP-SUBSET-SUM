Structured Polynomial-Time Subset Sum
This repository presents a self verified and rigrously developed attempt at a polynomial-time solution to the NP-complete Subset Sum problem. However, the work is currently ** under formal review at the Zenodo platform**. While it has not yet undergone external peer review or endorsement, it is shared here transparently for open scientific dialogue and constructive discussion.
This repository contains the research, code, and documentation for a proposed polynomial-time solution to the Subset Sum problem â€” a cornerstone in P vs NP theory.


The work explores structured input evaluation using log and exponential transformations while rigorously preserving polynomial time and space complexity. It offers a constructive counter-view to the traditional belief that Subset Sum belongs to the NP-hard class beyond polynomial reach.
